<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='introduction' class='c003'><span class='large'><b>INTRODUCTION</b></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_4 c008'>WITH as much grace as if a monoplanist
should attempt to write a preface to a
book on flying for an albatross, so may a
writer of mere prose attempt to pen an
introduction to a book of poetry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The bird and man both use the air, but with
a difference. So do the poet and the man of
prose use pen and ink.</p>

<p class='c009'>Familiarity with tools, used in two branches
of one art (or trade), is apt to prove a snare.</p>

<p class='c009'>Music and poetry, the most ethereal of the
arts upon the face of them, are in a way more
mathematical than prose, for both have formulæ.
Hence, their appeal goes quicker to
men’s minds, and oversteps countries and
languages to some degree, and makes it difficult
to write about them. Of late, young poets,
those who have bulked the largest in the public
eye, those that the world has hailed as modern,
have often been obscure. What is modernity?
To be modern is to touch the senses of the age
you write for. To me, a fool who owns a
motor-car is just as great a fool as was a fool
of the stone age.</p>

<p class='c009'>The only true modernity is talent, and Lucian
of Samosata was as modern to the full as Guy
de Maupassant. The poet for whose verses
I am writing this my introduction, preface,
foreword, call it what you will, is one of those
whose meaning he who runs may read.</p>

<p class='c009'>Does she do well in making herself clear?
I think so, for though there are those who prefer
a mist of words, holding apparently that
poetry should be written in Chinook, or
Malagasy, this opinion must of necessity be of
the nature of what Ben Jonson called a
“humour.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Few men to-day read Eupheus and fewer
Gongora. Yet in their time their concepts were
considered to be fine flowers of poetry. Those
who wrote so that all men could understand,
as Sapho, Campion, Jorge Maurique, Petrarca,
Villon, and their fellow-singers in the celestial
spheres where poets sing, crowned with the bays
of the approval of countless generations, all
wrote clearly. Their verses all were clear as is
the water running over chalk in a south country
trout-stream, such as the Itchin or the Test.</p>

<p class='c009'>I take two specimens of Miss Radclyffe-Hall’s
poetry to illustrate what I have said.
She writes of a blind ploughman, whose
prayer is to his friend to set him in the sun.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Turn my face towards the East</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And praise be to God.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>One sees him sitting, wrinkled and bent, and
ploughworn in the sun, and thanking God
according to his faith, for light interior, for that
interior vision which all the mystics claim.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“God who made His sun to shine</div>
      <div class='line in1'>On both you and me,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>God who took away my eyes,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>That my <i>soul</i> might see.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This shows the poet in an unusual light, for
most poets write on far different subjects; but
here is one which is eternal, and has been
eternal since the time of Œdipus.</p>

<p class='c009'>Again in the verses, “Thoughts at Ajaccio,”
she shows a love of the earth and of its fulness,
a feeling which has been the birthright of all
English writers of good verse from the remotest
times.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c002'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Fill me with scent of upturned ground,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Soft perfume from thy bosom drawn.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>This is the feeling that has inspired so many
poets, and shows the writer not striving to be
modern or filled with strange conceits; but with
a love and trust of the brown earth, from which

<p class='c014'>* A legend is attached to Raggedstone Hill in
Worcestershire. The Hill was cursed by a Benedictine
Monk. From time to time a great shadow rises up from
it, spreading across the surrounding country. Woe
betide those on whom the shadow falls, as it brings with
it terrible misfortune! Many of the people living near
Raggedstone still firmly believe in this legend.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Radclyffe-Hall has an exceptional gift
for enshrining a single thought or fancy in a little
lyric or a song. The little pieces ... most of
them catch a real thought, and sometimes—as in
“A Reflection”—one which makes the reader
pause and meditate. Many of her pieces seem
to have been put to music, and they deserve it.”—<i>The
Times, October 6th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall is already
known to many readers as the author of some sweet
and dainty verses. Her latest book should widen
the circle of those acquainted with her work, for
it shows her once more as a tender singer of the
spells of love, the beauty of Nature. There is in
many of her poems a wistfulness that is of beauty
rather than of sadness, while her power of expressing
her moods and thoughts in simple and melodious
rhythms is, perhaps, more markedly shown
here than in her earlier work. Here is a haunting
little piece from a trio of ‘Stuart Songs’ (quotation).
Part of the charm of this lies no doubt in the trick
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>of refrain, but, with her few simply chosen words,
the writer has suggested much of tenderness and
tragedy. Many of the pieces seem to have been
written with a view to musical setting, and express
a mood, a sentiment, in tuneful fashion, and with
a note of true sincerity. Here is a beautiful
picture, ‘In Liguria’” (quotation).—<i>Daily Telegraph,
November 16th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“<i>Poems of the Past and Present</i>, notwithstanding
their number, maintain a standard consistently
high. Fastidious workmanship, and an instinct
towards poetical grace in language and rhythm,
are, apart from inspiration, the two essentials for
the writing of lyrics; and the volume possesses
both in a marked degree, besides an appreciable
share of the rarer quality. Though the personal
note is seldom absent, and the dominance of love
as a theme makes more than ever for monotony
nowadays, these potential drawbacks are to a great
extent redeemed by the freshness and fancy which
go to the painting of, among many others, such
a haunting little picture as the following from
‘In Liguria’ (quotation). With her power of
delicate visualization, her keen sense of colour
and music, and a technique almost flawless, the
author should, as her poetical horizon broadens,
produce valuable results.”—<i>The Athenæum, December
3rd, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“One meets with many excellent lyrics scattered
through the pages. What is characteristic of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>best of them, which are to be found among the
unrhymed verses, is a certain Southern, almost
Oriental atmosphere, like the scent at dawn of
those strange blossoms of which she sings. This
is the appropriate setting, sometimes of a happy
licence of imagination, in a set of verses which will
repay perusal by a reader of poetic sympathies.”—<i>The
Scotsman, October 13th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“A poetess with a very charming gift ... her
little book should have a great vogue as a Christmas
gift-book.”—<i>Daily Express, July 7th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Radclyffe-Hall is facile, flowing, and
often really musical; it is not surprising that so
many of her verses have been used by composers.
Such a lyric as ‘A Farewell,’ calls aloud for setting.”—<i>Pall
Mall Gazette, December 2nd, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Many fair and gentle thoughts are gracefully
expressed by Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall. Especially
charming are the lyrics in the song sequence,
‘Fruit of the Nispero,’ and the three little ‘Stuart
Songs’ of Mary the Queen.”—<i>The Lady, December
29th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“There are a great many poems in this little
volume, all showing evidence of considerable
facility and talent.”—<i>Evening Standard, September
22nd, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“A book of verse that appeared lately, by Miss
Marguerite Radclyffe-Hall, will, I know, delight you,
for it is written with true poetical feeling, and
touches on so many subjects besides that of love,
that it is sure to please the taste of many and various
readers. Amongst the poems that I recommend
to your notice are ‘An Italian Garden,’ ‘A Sonnet
to Elizabeth Barrett Browning,’ which breathes
a deep and reverential appreciation of our great
poetess’s worth, ‘The Voice,’ and several numbers
in a series called ‘Fruit of the Nispero.’ It is
easy to imagine that many of these tuneful numbers
should have been set to music, for there are in them
such tender harmonies as must appeal to musical
people.”—<i>The Lady, November 17th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Her volume is full of pearls; they are to be
gathered from every page, and sometimes they are
very brilliant. ‘The Hills of By and Bye,’ ‘Before
Sunrise,’ ‘A Little Child,’ ‘In Liguria,’ and others
are beautiful poems; and ‘The Graveyard at
Orotava’ is based on an exquisitely poetic sentiment,
the last two verses showing a high quality
of imaginative power. Miss Radclyffe-Hall’s style
is individual and remarkable for combined force
and clarity. Very few living women poets are
at all her equal.”—<i>Sussex Daily News, October
26th, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“This is a book of really good verse. All its
‘small songs’ are musical and delicate, but in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>addition it has the rarer virtue of complete sincerity....
There is no striving after effect by
phrase or artifice. Every lyric is the simple
melodious expression of a poetic thought.”—<i>Evening
News, October 19th, 1910</i>.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Radclyffe-Hall’s latest book should widen
the circle of those acquainted with her work,
for it shows her once more as a tender singer of
the spells of love, the beauty of Nature.”—<i>Liverpool
Express, November 22nd, 1910.</i></p>

<p class='c017'>“Many of her pieces are just adapted to musical
setting, for they express a mood, a sentiment, a
graceful fancy, with a note of real sincerity.”—<i>Christian
Endeavour Times, December 22nd, 1910.</i></p>

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
